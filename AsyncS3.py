"""Async version of Amazon S3 access library.

The "boto" open source library supports synchronous operations against
S3, but does not have asynchronous support. In a high-scale server
environment, this is a real problem, because it is not permissible to
block threads waiting on network I/O. This module layers support for non-
blocking async operations over the boto library. It re-uses boto
functionality whenever possible.
